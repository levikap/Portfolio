We were given the data types we would have to work with, and a S-Expression parser, but had to integrate the parser with the raw data we were given, properly formatting it through the use of a number of visitors to make the data useful. We then designed a Controller and View, using Javaâ€™s Swing GUI framework."

I struggled the most with wrapping my head around the best way to represent all the different types of data we were working with efficiently. I did a lot of the GUI work and had a fun time learning the intricacies of Swing and gained valuable experience with using Frameworks in development."

It involved asynchronous play and communication through the terminal. This was my first introduction to the principles of MVC and Object-Oriented programming. I worked on this project solo and faced a number of difficulties. One of the design mistakes I made was organizing the pyramid as a 1D array, as I thought this would make it easier to test. I failed to fit the data to how the final product would appear, "
                description2="instead of designing the data around what I thought would be simplest. I did manage to fix my mistake and complete a working game of regular pyramid solitaire, I also implemented modified models to allow for playing tri-peaks, where there are three overlapping triangles (pictured above), and relaxed pyramid solitaire, which allows for removing overlapping cards that add to 13 if only one card is overlapping. These different versions extended the original Pyramid Solitaire class, only overriding methods that needed to be changed. "

To win, you need to solve the tile puzzle and then move the light to the right position to 'light them all'. This project expanded upon the tiles that Minesweeper introduced while adding some tricky new elements. We had to have a number of different versions of the game, one using a predefined grid pattern, one using a fractal pattern, and the final one using Kruskal's algorithm to form a random grid that reaches all squares and forms no loops. "
                description2="This was my first time working with a minimum spanning tree algorithm, and it was tricky to understand the implementation technique conceptually and connect it to the way our tiles generate. My partner and I also had a hard time understanding how to calculate the 'diameter' of the board, the longest distance that can be traveled, in order to determine whether the player won. We were able to do this by writing a breadth-first search algorithm. We leveraged an extra credit opportunity to add a main menu, a color gradient for the light, keyboard commands, and a scoring system. "

This was our first large-scale project, and we had to handle interactions between numerous methods. We used the impWorld library, "

One part of the assignment we found difficult was given our data being structured as a 1D array, how to determine the number of neighboring mines and properly arrange the grid. If I were to do this project again, I would probably choose to have the data as a 2D array, as it more closely resembles the way the cells are supposed to be positioned in the game. "
